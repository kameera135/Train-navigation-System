Some instructions. 
1. Always use simple letters to implement the code.
2. Some times give the instructions on how to answer the questions in the programme. 
3. for the program, stations defined as a 2 letter word. So the name of the station explained in the database of programmes. 
4. Add comments for the difficult rules. 
5. All programs run as a question, answering system. Answers generate better solutions. 

Q1 -> simple track with the same line.
Q2 -> first define the track and then can change the track in some stations.
Q3 -> has one track to 2 trains.
Q4 -> can change the track in the switch stations. 
Q5 -> change the direction at one point. Use the same track for 2 trains. 

The number of trains for tracks are cannot change within the programs. Some programs implement to change tracks. 

Some times warning masseges are showing. It is not harm for code. 
Some rules are same in all 5 programs.
